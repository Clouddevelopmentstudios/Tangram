# Tangram

Tangram is a Chromium-based Cloud App Browser. Tangram supports building web-style desktop applications. Bring components developed with desktop technology into the browser tab. Or add background page support for standalone desktop apps. Tangram makes your desktop application as easy to install as a website and enjoys dynamic updates.

Tangram is based on Chromium. We have retained the full functionality of Chromium.

Tangram can bring you a hybrid interface similar to the screenshot below.
