# Tangram

If you can build a desktop app, you can also build a browser app. Tangram is a browser that supports desktop technologies like C++/COM, .NET Winform, and Java SWT. You can use both web and desktop technologies to develop brwoser applications. Tangram makes your desktop app as easy to install as a website and enjoys the dynamic update feature.

Tangram is based on Chromium. We have retained the full functionality of Chromium.

Tangram can bring you a hybrid interface similar to the one below.
